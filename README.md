# ATM-Project
This project which allows to keep track of the state of an automated teller machine or ATM. An ATM is a machine that you can use to withdraw or deposit cash to your bank account. We've created a simple ATM with two components (the bank and the ATM) and synchronized them so that the account balance updates when cash is deposited or withdrawn.
